# About the project
## A Random Quote Generator
This is the 1st project for Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree program. It is about writing plain java script to generate a random quote, category, source, year and citation and display it beautifully on the page. It uses JSON object to define various attributes of a quote object. It also has features like new quote every 20 seconds and changing background color and text color for every new quote to provide more engaging user experience. 

## Version 1
In the first version, following features are implemented:
- Locate and select your own quotes
- Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
- Write functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
- Timer function that changes the quote automatically after 20 seconds
- If user changes the quote manually then timer gets reset
- Each time a quote changes, color theme also gets changed along with it to make it more engaging.
- Design is responsive and works well on mobile 

This project is a fun and effective way for me to practice fundamental JavaScript skills while also creating a simple interactive portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
